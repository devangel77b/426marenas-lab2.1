\caption{\label{tab:newtable1} Measured time $t$ for the system to move from rest to \qty{0.7}{\meter} as well as the resulting acceleration calculated via \cref{eq:13}, as hanging mass $m_2$ was varied between \qtyrange{0.050}{0.200}{\kilo\gram}.  Total cart mass $m_1 + m_c =\qty{1.493}{\kilogram}$. All values are listed as mean $\pm$ one standard deviation with $n=3$ replicates for each value of $m_2$.}
